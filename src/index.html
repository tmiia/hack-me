        <p>Bravo, <br> vous avez réussi à me hacker.</p>

        <p>Vous êtes rentré dans ma machine, dans mon tête..</p>

        <p>Vous savez maintenant que je suis une passionnée d'informatique, qui un jour s'est dit que créer des sites web c'était cool, mais que créer des sites intéractif et créatif ça l'était encore plus.</p>

        <p>Bravo, vous m'avez hacker.</p>

        <p>Vous devez donc savoir que je suis à la recherche d'une Alternance et d'une équipe de développeurs.euses passionés.es qui serait prête à me former !</p>

        <p>Et je pense que si vous êtes arrivée jusqu'ici...</p>
